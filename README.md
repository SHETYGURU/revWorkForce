## 🏗 System Architecture

RevWorkForce follows a layered architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

### Components
- **Presentation Layer (`com.revworkforce.menu`)**: Handles user input and displays menus.
- **Service Layer (`com.revworkforce.service`)**: Contains business logic, validation rules, and transaction management.
- **Data Access Layer (`com.revworkforce.dao`)**: Manages direct database interactions using JDBC `PreparedStatement` for security.
- **Model Layer (`com.revworkforce.model`)**: POJOs representing database entities.

## 🚀 Key Features & Modules

### 1. Core HR Management
*   **Employee Onboarding**:
    *   **Automated ID Generation**: System-generated IDs based on roles (e.g., `MGR001`, `EMP004`).
    *   **Profile Management**: Captures extensive details including emergency contacts and department allocation.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    *   **Admin**: Full system control, configuration, and user management.
    *   **Manager**: Team oversight, leave approvals, and performance reviews.
    *   **Employee**: Self-service for leaves, attendance, and profile updates.

### 2. Leave Management System
*   **Dynamic Leave Types**: Configurable leave types (Sick, Casual, Earned) via `LeaveType` model.
*   **Smart Balance Tracking**: Automatic deduction and balance verification logic in `LeaveService`.
*   **Approval Workflow**:
    *   Employees submit applications via `LeaveApplication`.
    *   Managers receive notifications for pending requests.
    *   Approvals/Rejections automatically update leave balances.

### 3. Performance Management
*   **Cycle-Based Reviews**: `PerformanceCycle` entity manages review periods (e.g., "Q1 2024").
*   **360-Degree Feedback**:
    *   **Self-Assessment**: Employees rate their own performance.
    *   **Manager Evaluation**: Managers provide ratings and detailed feedback.
*   **Goal Tracking**: `Goal` entity allows setting and tracking progress of specific objectives (#1 priority).

### 4. Attendance & Reporting
*   **Clock-In/Out**: Real-time attendance tracking with timestamp logging.
*   **Audit Logging**: `AuditService` records every critical action (LOGIN, UPDATE, DELETE) with IP tracking.
*   **Reports**: Administration reports for workforce analytics.

### 5. Communication Hub
*   **Announcements**: Admin-broadcasted messages visible to all employees.
*   **Notifications**: Targeted alerts for specific user actions (e.g., "Leave Approved").

## 🗄 Database Schema & Design

The database is normalized to 3NF to ensure data integrity.

### Key Entity Relationships (ERD Description)
1.  **Employees ↔ Departments**: Many-to-One. One department has many employees.
2.  **Employees ↔ Roles**: Many-to-Many (managed via `employee_roles`).
3.  **Employees ↔ LeaveApplications**: One-to-Many. An employee can have multiple leave requests.
4.  **Employees ↔ PerformanceReviews**: One-to-Many. Reviews are linked to specific cycles.

### Core Tables
*   `EMPLOYEES`: Master table for user data.
*   `LEAVE_BALANCES`: Tracks remaining leaves per type per year.
*   `AUDIT_LOGS`: Security-critical table for immutable action history.
*   `SYSTEM_POLICIES`: Key-value store for dynamic system configuration.

## 📱 Application Flow & Navigation

The application uses specific Menu classes to guide users based on their role:

### 1. Main Entry (`MainMenu.java`)
*   **Login**: Authenticates user credentials.
*   **Password Recovery**: "Forgot Password" flow using `SecurityQuestions`.

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`AdminMenu.java`)
*   `[1]` **User Management**: Add Employee, Update Roles, Unlock Accounts.
*   `[2]` **Department/Designation Config**: Manage foundational structures.
*   `[3]` **Leave Config**: Define new leave types.
*   `[4]` **Audit Logs**: View system-wide activity history.
*   `[5]` **System Policies**: Configure global settings.

### 3. Manager Dashboard (`ManagerMenu.java`)
*   `[1]` **My Team**: View direct reports and their details.
*   `[2]` **Leave Requests**: Approve/Reject pending applications.
*   `[3]` **Performance Reviews**: Conduct evaluations for team members.
*   `[4]` **Goal Management**: Assign goals to subordinates.

### 4. Employee Dashboard (`EmployeeMenu.java`)
*   `[1]` **My Profile**: View personal details and leave balances.
*   `[2]` **Apply Leave**: Submit new leave requests.
*   `[3]` **Attendance**: Mark daily attendance.
*   `[4]` **My Goals**: Update progress on assigned tasks.

## � Security & Compliance

### Authentication Security
*   **Hashing**: Passwords are **never** stored in plain text. We use `BCrypt` with salt to hash passwords.
*   **Account Locking**: Accounts are automatically locked after **3 failed login attempts**.
*   **Session Management**: `UserSession` ensures only one active user context per terminal instance.

### System Auditing
*   Every data modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) is intercepted by `AuditService`.
*   Logs include: `Actor ID`, `Action Type`, `Target Table`, `Old Value`, `New Value`, `Timestamp`.
